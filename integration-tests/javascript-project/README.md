# Integration Test for eslint-plugin-no-unsafe-innerhtml

This directory contains a complete integration test suite for the ESLint plugin that verifies:

1. **Plugin Detection**: Confirms the plugin correctly identifies `innerHTML` assignments
2. **Safe Code Acceptance**: Ensures safe patterns are not flagged
3. **Suggestion Quality**: Validates that suggestions are provided and work correctly
4. **Code Compilation**: Verifies suggested fixes result in syntactically valid code

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Test Structure

- `src/unsafe-examples.js` - Contains various `innerHTML` violations that should be caught
- `src/safe-examples.js` - Contains safe patterns that should NOT be flagged  
- `test-runner.js` - Comprehensive test script that validates all functionality
- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration using the plugin

## Expected Results

When running the tests, you should see:

```
